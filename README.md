The **Online Hospital Management System** is a Java-based application designed to streamline the process of hospital management by providing an integrated solution for patients and hospital staff. The system includes key features such as a **Welcome Frame** for easy access, a **Contributor Frame** for managing team contributions, and a **Registration Frame** where users fill in their personal information, including name, email, age, and gender. 

After registration, users can log in securely and request appointments from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need to visit the hospital in person. The system also incorporates an **online payment option**, allowing for hassle-free financial transactions. 

For administrators, the system offers an **Admin Panel** that provides a comprehensive overview of hospital operations, enabling the monitoring of user data and the ability to add or delete users as needed. This feature ensures better management and coordination.

This project addresses the real-life problem of inefficiencies in hospital management systems by providing a user-friendly, online platform. It saves time, reduces paperwork, enhances accessibility for patients, and simplifies administrative tasks, improving the overall healthcare experience for both users and hospital staff.
